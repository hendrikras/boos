This game is based on an JAVA applet authored by Jan Verhoeven and included as an example in the book "Toepassingen in Java" (ISBN: 9789039514603).
It has been ported to JavaScript and P5. There has been some use of LLM's for that purpose.

Several features have been added to the original concept: 
* a winter theme,
* increasingly complex levels
* lives
* start and highscore screen

## Development
install http-server locally:
``````
npm i
``````
start the local server
``````
npm start
``````

navigate your favorite browser to: http://localhost:8080/index.html

That's it, no bundler! Just edit the ES6 classes as they are.
