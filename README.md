This game is based on an JAVA applet authored by Jan Verhoeven and included as an example in the book "Toepassingen in Java" (ISBN: 9789039514603).

It has been ported to JavaScript and P5. Furthermore a winter theme has been added.

## Development
install http-server locally:

That's it, no bundler! Just edit the ES6 classes as they are.
